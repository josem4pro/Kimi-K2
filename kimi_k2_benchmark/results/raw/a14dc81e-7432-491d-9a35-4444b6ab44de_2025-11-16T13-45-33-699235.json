Cake + Bread\n   - Cake needs: eggs, flour, sugar\n   - Bread needs: flour\n   - Combined needs: eggs, flour, sugar\n   - This is possible - he needs all 3 ingredients\n\n2. Cake + Cookies\n   - Cake needs: eggs, flour, sugar\n   - Cookies need: eggs, sugar\n   - Combined needs: eggs, flour, sugar\n   - This is possible - he needs all 3 ingredients\n\n3. Bread + Cookies\n   - Bread needs: flour\n   - Cookies need: eggs, sugar\n   - Combined needs: flour, eggs, sugar\n   - This is possible - he needs all 3 ingredients\n\nLet me verify there are no other combinations:\n- Cake + Cake = same item (not allowed - must be different items)\n- Bread + Bread = same item (not allowed)\n- Cookies + Cookies = same item (not allowed)\n\nTherefore, the baker has 3 options for making exactly 2 different items:\n\n1. Cake and Bread\n2. Cake and Cookies\n3. Bread and Cookies",
